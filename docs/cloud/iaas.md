# IaaS Security

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.

## Vulnerability: Misconfigured ACLs
Misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs) can expose data to the public.

## How to Detect (with Code)
Regularly audit ACLs and security groups.
```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket my-bucket
```

Check if the Grantee is set to http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers.

## Mitigations
- Principle of Least Privilege: Grant only the necessary permissions.
- Automated Scanning: Use cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools to automatically detect misconfigurations.
