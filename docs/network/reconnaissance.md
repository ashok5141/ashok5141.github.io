# Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the first phase of a penetration test, where you gather information about the target.

## How to Detect (with Code)
Use passive and active methods to gather information.
```bash
whois example.com
nslookup example.com
```

These commands query public databases for information about the target domain.

## Mitigations
- Privacy Protection: Use domain privacy services to hide your contact information.
- Monitor Public Data: Regularly monitor public information about your organization to see what attackers can find.
