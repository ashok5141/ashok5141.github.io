## ⚠️ 3 Rules for Your First Month

1. **The "Slow Down" Rule:** To stop the shaking, count "1-2-3" while lowering the weight. This builds "lean" muscle density rather than just "puffy" size.
2. **Planet Fitness Specifics:** Locate the **30-Minute Circuit area** if the main floor is too crowded; it has many of these machines in a row.
3. **Food Quantity:** Stick to your **1,890 kcal**. Focus on **"Double Protein"**—if you have chicken, have two portions. If you have eggs, use 1 whole and 3 whites. This keeps you lean while the muscles grow.
