# Android Security

Securing Android applications requires a unique set of skills, including understanding how the Android OS works.

## Vulnerability: Hardcoded Credentials
Hardcoding credentials or API keys in the app's source code.

## How to Detect (with Code)
Decompile the APK file and search for hardcoded strings.
```bash
# Example command for decompilation (using jadx)
```bash
jadx -d output your_app.apk
```

## Mitigations
- Secure Storage: Store credentials in the Android Keystore or a secure vault.
- Secrets Management: Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.
