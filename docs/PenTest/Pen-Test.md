# Penetration Testing

Penetration testing, or ethical hacking, is the practice of actively trying to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a system to identify and fix security weaknesses.

## Phases of a Penetration Test

- **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the target. This can be passive (e.g., searching for public records) or active (e.g., using scanning tools).
- **Scanning:** Using tools to identify open ports, services, and potential entry points.
- **Gaining Access:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to get a foothold in the system.
- **Maintaining Access:** Ensuring continued access to the system.
- **Covering Tracks:** Removing evidence of the attack to avoid detection.
