# Cloud Security

Cloud security involves protecting data, applications, and infrastructure from threats in the cloud.

## Shared Responsibility Model

Cloud security is a partnership between the cloud provider and the customer.

- **Cloud Provider (e.g., AWS, GCP):** Responsible for the security *of* the cloud (infrastructure, hardware).
- **Customer:** Responsible for security *in* the cloud (data, applications, access control).

### Common Threats

- **Misconfigured Services:** Leaving services exposed to the public internet.
- **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Weak Access Management:** Poorly managed credentials and permissions.
