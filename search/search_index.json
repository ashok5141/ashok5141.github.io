After they enter their Okta password and perhaps an MFA code, they are automatically redirected back to Salesforce and logged in. They never have to see or remember their Salesforce credentials.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How it does the SAML autheication and process:<ol> <li>User Access: A user tries to access a SAML-enabled application (the SP).</li> <li>Redirect to IdP: The SP recognizes that it's configured for SSO and redirects the user's browser to Okta (the IdP).</li> <li>Authentication with IdP: The user authenticates with Okta (if they havn't already in the current session).

While OAuth 2.0  is an authorization protocol (granting access to resources), OIDC adds an identity layer that allows an application to verify a user's identity and get basic profile information. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) as the standard token format, which are more lightweight and easier for web applications and APIs to work with then the XML used in SAML.</p> <ul> <li>Example in a Software Company OIDC</li> <li>A software company is building a new customer portal using a modern microservices architecture.

They register the application in Okta and get a <code>client_id</code> and <code>client_secret</code>.</li> <li>User Experience: A customer visits the portal and clicks \"Sign in.\" The portal redirects them to a customizable Okta-hosted login page. After they log in, Okta sends back a series of tokens. The portal uses these tokens to confirm the customer's identity and create their session. The portal can then use the access token to securely call other internal APIs on behalf of the user (e.g., an API that fetches their past orders).</li> </ul> </li> <li>How it does the OIDC autheication and process:<ol> <li>User Initiation: A user clicks a \"Login with Okta\" button on a modern web application (e.g., a Single-Page Application or mobile app).</li> <li>Authorization Request: The application (the \"client\") sends an authorization request to Okta's authorization server. This request includes a <code>client_id</code>, <code>redirect_uri</code>, and requested scopes (e.g., <code>openid</code>, <code>profile</code>, <code>email</code>) which specify the user information the app needs.</li> <li>User Authentication: Okta's authorization server handles user authentication.</li> <li>Token Exchange: After the user authenticates, Okta returns an authorization code to the client application.

Use static analysis tools like MobSF to decompile the app and search for hardcoded API keys, tokens, and credentials in the source code. Use a proxy tool like Burp Suite to intercept network traffic and check for authentication credentials being sent in plaintext or weak formats. Do not embed or hardcode any credentials directly in the app. Utilize secure credential storage, such as a mobile key management service or platform-specific secure storage (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain). Implement server-side authentication with temporary, short-lived tokens. M2 Inadequate Supply Chain Security: This refers to risks introduced by using third-party libraries, SDKs, or other components that may contain known vulnerabilities, outdated code, or malicious functionality. Use dependency scanning tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and SDKs used in the app. Analyze the app's build process to ensure all dependencies are from trusted sources. Maintain a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the app. Regularly update all third-party libraries and dependencies to the latest, most secure versions. Vet all external components for known vulnerabilities before integration. M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization: This vulnerability involves flaws in how an application verifies user identity (authentication) or grants access to resources (authorization), allowing an attacker to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access. Use a proxy tool like Burp Suite to manipulate authentication requests. Try to bypass the login process by replaying requests with a different user ID, or by using stolen/expired session tokens. Test for weak password policies, lack of MFA, and improper session management. Implement strong authentication policies, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and account lockout after repeated failed login attempts. Ensure all authentication and authorization logic is performed on the server-side, and that sessions are properly managed and invalidated after a period of inactivity or on logout. M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation: This occurs when an application fails to properly validate, sanitize, or encode user-provided data, which can lead to injection attacks like SQL injection, command injection, or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Use a proxy tool like Burp Suite to modify input fields with common attack strings for SQL injection, command injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Observe how the app and its backend handle these malicious inputs. Check for reflected or stored XSS vulnerabilities. Validate all user input on both the client and server side. Use parameterized queries for database interactions to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize and encode all output displayed in the app to prevent XSS and other injection attacks. M5 Insecure Communication: This vulnerability arises from the failure to use encryption or from using weak encryption during data transmission between the mobile app and its server, making data susceptible to interception and eavesdropping. Use a proxy tool like Burp Suite to intercept network traffic. Check if the app is using HTTP instead of HTTPS. Analyze the TLS/SSL configuration to ensure a secure cipher suite is used. Test for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks to see if the app accepts insecure connections or fails to validate server certificates. Enforce the use of TLS/SSL for all network communication. Implement strong certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks and ensure the app only communicates with trusted servers. Avoid allowing the app to accept self-signed or invalid certificates. M6 Inadequate Privacy Controls: This issue is related to the app's failure to handle sensitive user data in a secure and compliant manner, such as storing personal information unencrypted or transmitting it to unauthorized third parties without user consent. Use a file system explorer on a rooted/jailbroken device to check for sensitive personal data (e.g., PII, health information) stored insecurely. Analyze network traffic with a proxy tool to see if private data is transmitted unencrypted or to unauthorized third-party services. Minimize the collection and storage of sensitive user data. Anonymize or encrypt all private data both in transit and at rest. Ensure data handling complies with privacy regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and other country-specific laws. M7 Insufficient Binary Protections: This involves a lack of security measures in the app's executable code, which can make it easy for attackers to reverse engineer, tamper with, or debug the app to discover its inner workings or bypass controls. Use dynamic analysis tools like Frida or Objection to test for and bypass security controls like root/jailbreak detection, debugger detection, or anti-tampering checks. Use a static analysis tool like MobSF to identify if the app binary has been obfuscated or protected against reverse engineering. Implement binary hardening techniques such as code obfuscation, anti-tampering, and anti-debugging. Use strong root/jailbreak detection and integrity checks to prevent the app from running on a compromised device. M8 Security Misconfiguration: This occurs when the application or its underlying server and components are configured with insecure settings, such as having debug mode enabled in a production environment, or using default passwords for admin interfaces. Use a static analysis tool like MobSF to review the app's manifest file (e.g., AndroidManifest.xml) for insecure settings such as debuggable flags enabled in production, or public-facing components that shouldn't be. On the server side, check for open ports, default credentials, or directory listings. Adhere to secure configuration baselines. Disable debugging and other development-related features in production builds. Follow the principle of least privilege by ensuring all components have minimal permissions required to function. M9 Insecure Data Storage: This vulnerability occurs when an application stores sensitive data on the mobile device's local storage in an unencrypted or easily accessible format, allowing attackers with physical access or a compromised device to retrieve it. Use a file system viewer on a rooted/jailbroken device to inspect the app's data directories. Look for sensitive data in databases (<code>.db</code>), shared preferences (<code>.xml</code>), or unencrypted files. Use a tool like SQLite Browser to open and inspect local databases. Avoid storing sensitive data on the device whenever possible. When necessary, use the platform's secure storage APIs (e.g., iOS Keychain, Android Keystore). Encrypt all sensitive data at rest using strong encryption algorithms. M10 Insufficient Cryptography: This is the failure to use strong, modern, and well-vetted cryptographic algorithms to protect data. This includes using outdated or broken encryption methods, or implementing custom, flawed crypto logic. Use a static analysis tool like MobSF to identify the cryptographic algorithms used by the app. Use a proxy tool to analyze encrypted network traffic for weak or outdated cipher suites. Attempt to tamper with encrypted data to check for proper integrity checks. Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES-256). Avoid implementing custom or homegrown cryptographic solutions. Ensure proper key management and secure key exchange. Do not use outdated or broken algorithms like MD5 or RC4. New 1 Data Leakage: This occurs when sensitive information is unintentionally exposed and stored in insecure locations like logs, crash reports, or temporary files, making it accessible to other applications or attackers. Use a proxy tool like Burp Suite to capture all network traffic and analyze it for sensitive data being sent or received. On a rooted/jailbroken device, use a file system explorer to check log files (<code>logcat</code> for Android) and local storage for plaintext sensitive information. Avoid logging or storing any sensitive data on the device. Ensure that any temporary files are immediately and securely deleted after use. Use the device's secure storage mechanisms and encrypt data both at rest and in transit. New 2 Hardcoded Secrets: This vulnerability involves embedding confidential information, such as API keys, cryptographic keys, or credentials, directly into the app's source code or configuration files. This allows attackers to easily extract them through reverse engineering. Use static analysis tools like MobSF or a decompiler like JADX to analyze the app's code. Search for hardcoded strings that look like API keys, URLs, or other secrets. Run the <code>strings</code> command on the app binary to quickly find plaintext strings. Do not hardcode secrets. Use a secure key management system, store credentials on a remote server, or leverage platform-specific secure storage (e.g., iOS Keychain, Android Keystore). New 3 Insecure Access Control: This is a failure to properly restrict a user's access to certain functions or data. An attacker can exploit this to access information or perform actions they are not authorized for, either as a different user (horizontal privilege escalation) or as an administrator (vertical privilege escalation). Use a proxy tool like Burp Suite. Authenticate as a standard user, then try to access privileged endpoints or data by manually changing request parameters. Test for both horizontal (accessing another user's data by changing a user ID) and vertical (accessing an admin-only function) privilege escalation. Enforce strict access control rules on the server side for every request. Never rely on client-side checks for authorization. Implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring users can only access what is absolutely necessary for their role. New 4 Path Overwrite and Path Traversal: This vulnerability allows an attacker to read or write files outside of the app's intended directory. It is often caused by insufficient validation of user input that includes file paths, allowing an attacker to use special characters like <code>../</code> to navigate the file system. Use a proxy tool like Burp Suite to inject path traversal sequences (<code>../</code>, <code>..\\</code>) into any user-controllable input that involves file operations, such as file uploads or image loading. Check if the app or server reads or writes files to an unintended location. Sanitize all user input related to file paths. Implement a strict allow-list of acceptable file names and paths. Use platform-specific file system APIs that are designed to prevent path traversal attacks. New 5 Unprotected Endpoints: This vulnerability affects the app's components (like Android Activities, Services, or iOS Deeplinks) that can be invoked from other apps. If these components are not properly secured, a malicious app can call them and pass malicious data to compromise the application. Use static analysis tools like MobSF to review the app's manifest file and identify all exported components. On a test device, use tools like <code>adb</code> (for Android) to try and launch these components with malicious data to see if a crash or other unexpected behavior occurs. Ensure that app components are not exported unless absolutely necessary. When an endpoint must be exposed, protect it with proper permissions. Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any data received by these endpoints from external sources. New 6 Unsafe Sharing: This vulnerability occurs when an application uses insecure methods for inter-app communication, which can lead to the unintended exposure of sensitive data to other applications on the same device. This often involves using insecure intents or content providers. Use dynamic analysis and a file system viewer on a rooted/jailbroken device to monitor data being passed between apps. Look for sensitive data being written to shared directories that are not properly secured or for broad intent filters that could be intercepted by other apps. Use explicit and secure intents for inter-app communication. When sharing sensitive data, use private Content Providers and enforce strict permissions to ensure only authorized applications can access the data."},{"location":"MobileSec/Mobile-Security-Basics/#owasp-masvs-vs-mastg","title":"OWASP MASVS vs MASTG","text":"<ul> <li>OWASP MASVS and OWASP MASTG are two foundational frameworks for mobile security, but they serve different purpose.</li> <li>They provide a comprehensive approch that goes far beyond the high-level OWASP Top 10 list.</li> </ul> OWASP MASVS OWASP MASTG FullName Mobile Application Security Verification Standard Mobile Application Security Testing Guide Purpose A standard for defining what a secure mobile app should look like.

This can lead to the disclosure or leaking of sensitive information, data integrity issues (modifying, adding, or deleting data), elevation of privileges, or gaining access to the back-end network. The core problem is that the SQL parser cannot distinguish between code and data when untrusted input is included in SQL statements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vulnerable Code Example:     Applications often construct SQL statements by concatenating user-supplied input directly into the query string without proper sanitization.     <pre><code>// Java example from OWASP Guide\nHttpServletRequest request = ...;\nString userName = request.getParameter(\"name\");\nConnection con = ...;\nString query = \"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name = '\" + userName + \"'\"; // Vulnerable concatenation\ncon.execute(query);\n</code></pre>     An attacker could input <code>\"' OR 1=1\"</code> for <code>userName</code>, making the query:     <code>SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name = '' OR 1=1'</code>. This would return all user records.</p> <p>Another example from \"The Web Application Hacker's Handbook\" for an ASP.NET application: <pre><code>// C# .NET example (representative, based on)\nstring employeeID = request.getParameter(\"ei_id\");\nstring sql = \"SELECT name, lastname FROM authors WHERE ei_id = '\" + employeeID + \"'\"; // Vulnerable\n// ... execute sql\n</code></pre> An attacker could insert <code>\"123';DROP TABLE pubs --\"</code> for <code>employeeID</code>, executing <code>SELECT name, lastname FROM authors WHERE ei_id = '123'; DROP TABLE pubs --'</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Root Cause: The primary root cause is the unprotected concatenation of untrusted user input directly into SQL statements. This occurs because the SQL parser cannot distinguish between the developer's intended code and the malicious data injected by the attacker. Additionally, a lack of input validation or parameter mishandling can expose this flaw.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remediation / Secure Fix:</p> <ol> <li>Parameterize SQL queries: This is considered one of the most effective ways to prevent SQL Injection. It involves using SQL methods provided by the programming language or framework that explicitly separate code from data.</li> <li>Use Stored Procedures: While generally helpful, stored procedures must be correctly implemented and not build dynamic SQL statements internally using untrusted input, as this can reintroduce the vulnerability.</li> <li>Input Validation: Always validate user input by testing type, length, format, and range. Accept only expected values and reject entries containing binary data, escape sequences, or comment characters. Implement multiple layers of validation.</li> <li>HtmlEncode all user input: This can mitigate some forms of injection, though it's not a complete solution for SQL injection specifically.</li> <li>Developer Training: Train developers in secure coding techniques to avoid common vulnerabilities.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Corrected Code Example:     Using parameterized queries in Java:     <pre><code>// Java example with PreparedStatement from OWASP Guide\nHttpServletRequest request = ...;\nString userName = request.getParameter(\"name\");\nConnection con = ...;\nString query = \"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name = ?\"; // Use a placeholder\nPreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement(query);\npstmt.setString(1, userName); // Set parameter safely\nResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery();\n</code></pre>     Using parameterized queries in .NET:     <pre><code>// C# .NET example (representative, based on)\nusing (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString)) {\n    DataSet dataObj = new DataSet();\n    SqlDataAdapter sqlAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(\"StoredProc\", conn);\n    sqlAdapter.SelectCommand.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; // Or CommandType.Text for direct query\n    sqlAdapter.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add(\"@usrId\", SqlDbType.VarChar, 15);\n    sqlAdapter.SelectCommand.Parameters[\"@usrId\"].Value = UID.Text;\n    // ... execute\n}\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Explanation of Fix: Parameterized queries (and correctly implemented stored procedures) explicitly tell the database engine which parts of the statement are code and which are data, preventing the attacker's input from being interpreted as executable SQL. The database treats the user-supplied value as a literal string, even if it contains SQL syntax.

Unlike XSS, CSRF attacks target the application's functionality, not its users directly, by leveraging the trust the application has in the user's browser.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vulnerable Behavior Example: (Representative, based on's explanation)     A banking application allows a user to transfer funds via a POST request that looks like:     <code>POST /transfer HTTP/1.1</code> <code>Cookie: sessionid=abc...</code> <code>amount=1000&amp;account=attacker_account</code></p> <p>If this request doesn't include any unpredictable tokens, an attacker can create a malicious HTML page: <pre><code>&lt;!-- Malicious HTML page --&gt;\n&lt;form action=\"http://bank.com/transfer\" method=\"POST\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"amount\" value=\"1000\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"account\" value=\"attacker_account\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Click me!\"&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n    document.forms.submit(); // Auto-submits the form\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> If a logged-in user visits this page, the form is submitted to <code>bank.com</code> with the user's session cookie, performing the transfer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Root Cause: The root cause is that the application relies solely on session cookies for tracking user sessions and does not include any unique, unpredictable, and user-specific token in sensitive requests to verify that the request originated from the legitimate user's browser. Browsers automatically include session cookies with cross-site requests, which the application implicitly trusts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remediation / Secure Fix:</p> <ol> <li>Anti-CSRF Tokens (Synchronizer Token Pattern): The primary defense is to include a unique, unpredictable, and cryptographically strong anti-CSRF token in every state-changing request.

It should be placed in hidden form fields or custom HTTP headers, not in cookies.</li> <li>SameSite Cookie Attribute: Use the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute (<code>Lax</code> or <code>Strict</code>) to instruct browsers to restrict sending cookies with cross-site requests.

When the user clicks for the \"prize,\" they unknowingly trigger the purchase on the legitimate site.</p> </li> <li> <p>Root Cause: The root cause is the absence of proper frame-busting defenses (HTTP headers) by the legitimate application, allowing it to be embedded within iframes on other domains.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remediation / Secure Fix:</p> <ol> <li>X-Frame-Options Header: Implement the <code>X-Frame-Options</code> HTTP header with <code>DENY</code> or <code>SAMEORIGIN</code> values to prevent the page from being embedded in iframes on other domains.</li> <li>Content Security Policy (CSP) <code>frame-ancestors</code> directive: Use CSP's <code>frame-ancestors</code> directive for more granular control over framing.</li> <li>Frame-Busting JavaScript: While less reliable than headers, JavaScript frame-busting code can be used as a secondary defense.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Explanation of Fix: The <code>X-Frame-Options</code> header instructs the browser not to display the page in a frame if it's from a different origin, directly preventing clickjacking attacks by removing the attacker's ability to overlay content.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"appsec/WAHH/#client-side-cookie-injection","title":"Client-Side Cookie Injection","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Description / Definition: Client-side cookie injection allows an attacker to inject arbitrary cookies into a user's browser for a specific domain. This can bypass certain client-side controls or lead to session fixation if the application accepts the injected cookie as a valid session identifier.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vulnerable Behavior Example: (Representative, based on)     An application echoes unvalidated user input into a JavaScript string that is then used to set a cookie.     <pre><code>// JavaScript (representative)\ndocument.cookie = \"user=\" + decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.substring(1)); // Vulnerable\n</code></pre>     An attacker crafts a URL like <code>http://example.com/page#user=attacker%3B%20sessionid=fixedvalue</code>, which could inject <code>sessionid</code> into the victim's cookies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Root Cause: The root cause is the unvalidated inclusion of user-controlled data into client-side scripts that set cookies, or server-side reflected input that can influence client-side cookie setting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remediation / Secure Fix:</p> <ol> <li>Strict Client-Side Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user input used in client-side scripts before it is used to set cookies.</li> <li>Output Encoding: Properly encode user input on the server-side before reflecting it into JavaScript or HTML where it might influence cookie setting.</li> <li>Server-Side Session Fixation Prevention: Implement server-side session fixation prevention by issuing a new session ID after login.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Explanation of Fix: Strict validation and encoding prevent malicious characters from being interpreted as cookie-setting commands in client-side scripts.

Shared Hosting and Architecture Vulnerabilities","text":"<p>These vulnerabilities arise from weaknesses in the application's overall architecture, especially in multi-tiered or shared hosting environments. Improper segregation or trust relationships can allow a compromise in one component or application to affect others.</p>"},{"location":"appsec/WAHH/#inadequate-segregation-in-tiered-architectures","title":"Inadequate Segregation in Tiered Architectures","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Description / Definition: In multi-tiered architectures (e.g., web server, application server, database server), inadequate segregation means that a compromise in one tier can lead to compromise of other tiers due to overly permissive trust relationships. For example, if the web application runs with high database privileges, a SQL injection on the web tier can fully compromise the database.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vulnerable Behavior Example:</p> <ul> <li>Web application connecting to the database using the DBA (Database Administrator) account, instead of a least-privileged account.</li> <li>Application server process having file read/write access to MySQL data files.</li> <li>Decryption keys for sensitive data stored on the same tier as the encrypted data.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Root Cause: The root cause is the failure to apply the principle of least privilege across different tiers and components. Implicit trust is often placed between tiers, assuming that a higher-tier component will always properly enforce security controls for lower tiers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remediation / Secure Fix:</p> <ol> <li>Principle of Least Privilege: Apply the principle of least privilege rigorously across all tiers and components. Each tier should only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform its function.</li> <li>Separate Accounts/Permissions: Use separate, restricted accounts for database access, file system operations, and inter-component communication, each with only the necessary permissions.</li> <li>Secure Key Management: Store decryption keys in a separate, highly secured key management system or different tier, separate from the encrypted data.</li> <li>Network Segmentation: Implement strict network segmentation between tiers to limit direct communication paths and enforce security policies.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Explanation of Fix: Applying least privilege minimizes the \"blast radius\" of a compromise. If the web tier is compromised, an attacker cannot automatically gain DBA privileges if the web application only connects with a limited-privilege account. Segregating keys and sensitive data prevents direct access to them even if the application component itself is breached.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"appsec/WAHH/#15-vulnerable-server-configuration-and-software","title":"15.

All input from users, external components, or untrusted sources must be validated and sanitized.</li> <li>Validate on Output (Context-Sensitive Encoding): For vulnerabilities like XSS, output encoding based on the context of where data is inserted into HTML, JavaScript, or URLs is paramount. Input validation helps, but output encoding is the critical control for display.</li> <li>Separate Code from Data: For injection vulnerabilities (SQL, LDAP, XPath, OS Command, Script), the core issue is the blending of code and data. Use parameterized queries or APIs that strictly separate user input from executable commands/queries.</li> <li>Implement Robust Authorization Server-Side: All access control decisions must be enforced on the server-side. Client-side controls are easily bypassed. Employ least privilege and perform per-resource/per-function authorization checks.</li> <li>Strong Cryptography: Use standard, well-vetted, and cryptographically strong algorithms for hashing passwords (with salts and adaptive functions) and encrypting sensitive data. Never \"roll your own crypto\".</li> <li>Secure Session Management: Generate cryptographically strong and unpredictable session IDs. Regenerate session IDs upon authentication or privilege change. Transmit session tokens only over HTTPS and use <code>Secure</code> and <code>HttpOnly</code> flags.</li> <li>Generic Error Handling: Avoid verbose error messages, stack traces, or debug information in production. Provide generic error messages to prevent information leakage.</li> <li>Secure Defaults and Hardening: Always change default credentials and remove unnecessary services, content, and debug functionality in production environments. Configure components with the principle of least privilege.</li> <li>Defense in Depth: No single control is foolproof. Implement multiple layers of security controls throughout the application's design and development lifecycle to provide redundancy in case one defense fails.</li> <li>Regular Security Testing &amp; Code Review: Conduct manual secure code reviews and penetration testing in addition to automated tools. Manual review provides contextual understanding and can find subtle logic flaws that tools miss. Automated tools can aid in finding common vulnerabilities and scanning large codebases.</li> <li>Developer Education: Many vulnerabilities stem from a lack of security awareness. Continuous training for developers on secure coding practices is crucial.</li> </ol> <p>By adhering to these principles, developers can significantly reduce the attack surface and enhance the overall security posture of web applications.</p>"}]}
